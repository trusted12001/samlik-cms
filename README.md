- **Responsive Front-end**: Utilises Constrion Architecture for a modern and mobile-friendly interface.
- **Clean Admin Dashboard**: Built with Argon Dashboard Master for easy management of users and content.

## Local Development Setup

Follow these steps to get the CMS running on your local machine:

1. **Install XAMPP**  
   Ensure you have a functioning XAMPP stack with Apache and MySQL services running.

2. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/trusted12001/samlik-cms.git
   cd samlik-cms
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   Use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to install PHP dependencies:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

4. **Configure Environment**  
   - Copy the example file:  
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
   - Update your `.env` file with database credentials and any mail settings.  
   - Generate an application key:  
     ```bash
     php artisan key:generate
     ```

5. **Set Up the Database**  
   - Create a new database (e.g. `samlik_engineering_db`) via phpMyAdmin or another MySQL tool.  
   - Migrate tables and seed initial data (if any):  
     ```bash
     php artisan migrate
     # php artisan db:seed  // If there is a seeder in the project
     ```

6. **Run the Development Server**  
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```
   Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to view the CMS homepage.
